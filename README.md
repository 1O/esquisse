> Shiny gadget to explore data with ggplot2

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dreamRs/esquisse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dreamRs/esquisse)


This addin allows you to interactively explore your data by visualizing it with the ggplot2 package. It allows you to draw bar graphs, curves, scatter plots, histograms, then export the graph or retrieve the code generating the graph.

:construction: :warning: Under development !! :warning: :construction:


To try it, run : 

```r
source("https://install-github.me/dreamRs/esquisse")
```

Then launch the addin via the RStudio menu, if you don't have `data.frame` in your environment, datasets in `ggplot2` are used.
